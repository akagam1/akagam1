## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arjun, a final year undergraduate student at BITS Pilani, Goa Campus

- âš¡ My interests are mainly in Machine Learning, Multi-Agent coordination, and Numerical Techniques for solving systems of equations.
- ðŸ”­ Currently working on learning based methods that enforce exact physics with a discrete exterior calculus framework, particularly for elliptic PDEs
- ðŸ’¬ My math interests lie in Linear Algebra and Functional Analysis (and by extension, analysis of Differential Equations).

Would love to work on and contribute to related work. Feel free to reach out for the same :)

Feel free to contact me on [email](arjunputhli2003@gmail.com).
